                                 Diet

              83% of farmland is for meat and dairy ONLY.
              86% of land animals are livestock or humans!
    Livestock like cows take a lot of water and resources to cultivate.

                      Solution: eat less meat!
   I know what you're thinking, I love meat just like any other person.
  But a vegan diet would result in 63% reduced greenhouse gas emissions!
While you don't need to cut meat entirely, track your meat consumption and
      try to reduce it in favor of more nutritional alternatives.
                Make sure meat isn't wasted / spoiled.
  At your next backyard BBQ, try adding veggie skewers and fruit instead
                    of another pack of sausages.
