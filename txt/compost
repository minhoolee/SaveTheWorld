                                Compost

             1.3 billion tons of food are wasted each year.
       This is a big problem because food landfills produce methane,
         which is 70 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat.

                  Solution: take the time to compost!
       Separate food items from your trash and make a compost pile.
Be creative! Compete with your friends to see who can make the biggest pile!
   If your city doesn't have a city compost pile, maybe you can make one!
