                                  Unplug

    Even when devices like TVs are turned off, they still drain energy.
       Today, 63% of electricity is still from fossil fuels like coal.

                   Solution: be efficient and unplug!
Energy-efficiency saves money and stops millions of tons of greenhouse gases.
              Turn off the lights when they're not in use.
  Plug appliances into power strips and unplug those strips when not in use!
       Again, try making it a competition! In 2009, 6 cities in Kansas
      had a friendly competition to see who could save the most energy.
  See if you can similarly compete against your friends to seize the title!


        Summary: creatively implement community-based solutions like
        composting, dieting, and unplugging to combat climate change!
